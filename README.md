# VRIF
A simple collection of interaction scripts based on Steam VR 2.2. 
# SETUP:
Setup a Unity VR project and add Steam VR from the asset store. Add the 'hand controller' script to the both hands under the camera rig. 
That's it!
Adding these srcipts to objects will allow them to be interactable in the respective way.
For example, Adding a 'grabbable' script to an object will add automatically add the required components for it to work. 
# Note: 
All interactable  Objects require an 'Interactable' script. Don't worry, they are automatically added when adding interactable component like 'grabbable' or 'snappable'.
