# VRIF
A simple collection of interaction scripts based on Steam VR 2.2. 
# SETUP:
Setup a Unity VR project and add Steam VR from the asset store. Add the respective scripts or prefabs. 
Adding these scripts to objects will allow them to be interactable in the respective way, or provide the respective function.
Check out the prefabs for where to add the scripts.
For example, Adding a 'grabbable' script to an object will add automatically add the required components for it to work or adding the 'teleport' script to a Hand in the camera rig will add the ability to teleport. 
# Note: 
All interactable  Objects require an 'Interactable' script. Don't worry, they are automatically added when adding interactable component like 'grabbable' or 'snappable'.
